# Decoding the Evolution of Data Science: Unravelling Trends in Learning, Language, and Remote Work with Stack Overflow Data (2017â€“2023)
# Used Libraries
In this python project CRISP DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) functionality was enriched through the integration of NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 
NumPy was used for numerical tasks, Pandas was used for managing structured data, Matplotlib was used for visual representation, and Seaborn for advanced statistical graphics, the project systematically examined a dataset.
The workflow included data loading, preparation and insightful visualizations, offering complete discernment of patterns and trends. The amalgamation of these libraries streamlines and augments the CRISP DM process, finally assisting in well-informed decision-making.
# Used Data Stack Overflow Survey 2017-2023
The Stack Overflow Survey 2017-2023 dataset is a comprehensive collection of responses from the Stack Overflow annual developer survey conducted in years 2017 through 2023. This dataset encompassed a wide range of information related to developers including data scientists, their demographics, professional backgrounds, preferences, and opinions.
# Project Summary
Within the ever-evolving landscape of software development, it is imperative to grasp the methods to learn code, preferences and similarity to global trends of data scientist. This article utilizes the extensive data gathered from 2017 to 2023 Stack Overflow Survey, enhanced by the inclusion of Year as an additional variable, to delve into and address pivotal inquiries regarding methods to learn programming languages, preferred programming languages and remote work trends.
# Project Questions
Question 1: - How do data scientists learn how to code over years?
Question 2: - What are the most popular languages among data scientists over the years and are they different from developers?
Question 3: - What is the trend in remote work among data scientists and developers over the years?
